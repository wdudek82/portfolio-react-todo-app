# Portfolio: React ToDo App

## Because why not (read - becase you need to start somewhere;))

### Tools used

1. React
2. CSS in JS (styled-components)

### TODO:

1. ~~Form for adding new items~~
2. Edit existing todo items
2. ~~Event handler for removing all todo items~~
3. ~~Sandbox Component grew quite big, so now it would be the right moment to refator it, and split it~~
4. Adding routing using React Router
5. Adding React to handle state (it may look like ovekill, but intentional)
6. Data persistence in some kind of DB (Firebase?)
7. Async actions with React Thunk
