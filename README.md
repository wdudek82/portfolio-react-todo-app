# Portfolio: React ToDo App

## Because why not (read - becase you need to start somewhere;))

### Tools used

1. React
2. CSS in JS (styled-components)

### TODO:

1. Edit existing todo items
2. Items filters
3. Form validation + error messages
4. Add drag & drop items?
5. Split Navbar to Navigation and NavigationItem(s)
6. Add themes/global CSS variables/SCSS helpers using styled-components and polished
7. Adding Redux to handle state (and that is intentional overkill)
8. Data persistence of some kind (Firebase?)
9. User accounts, authentication/authorization
10. Async actions with React Thunk
11. ~~Form for adding new items~~
12. ~~Clicking pencil icon switch to edit mode~~
13. ~~Event handler for removing all todo items~~
14. ~~Sandbox Component grew quite big, so now it would be the right moment to refator it, and split it~~
15. ~~Adding routing using React Router~~
