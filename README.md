# Portfolio: React (Turbo) ToDo App

## Because why not

### Tools used

1. React
2. Router v4 (react-router-dom)
3. Redux, react-redux, redux-devtools-extension
4. CSS in JS (styled-components)

### TODO:

* [ ] Move Todo header state to store
* [ ] auto-focus on dynamic inputs (using refs?)
* [ ] Add cancel/accept icons to header input
* [ ] Items filters
* [ ] Form validation + error messages
* [ ] Make it fully responsive
* [ ] React Intl?
* [ ] Add drag & drop items?
* [ ] Split Navbar to Navigation and NavigationItem(s)
* [ ] Data persistence of some kind (Firebase?)
* [ ] User accounts, authentication/authorization
* [ ] Async actions with React Thunk
* [ ] List of todo lists (ability to: add, view, and remove them)
* [ ] Lists sharing with other users
* [ ] Real time updates with websockets
* [ ] Jest + Enzyme test for reducers and components
* [x] Edit TODO List Header
* [x] Confirm item update with Enter, cancel with Esc
* [x] Edit existing todo items
* [x] Cancel editing todo item
* [x] Add themes/global CSS variables/SCSS helpers using styled-components and polished
* [x] Adding Redux to handle state (and that is intentional overkill)
* [x] Form for adding new items
* [x] Clicking pencil icon switch to edit mode
* [x] Event handler for removing all todo items
* [x] Sandbox Component grew quite big, so now it would be the right moment to refator it, and split it
* [x] Adding routing using React Router
